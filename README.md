# MOVIEJO

### Description
A Flixter-like web application that allows to browse through and search for movies. It also has a user system that allows to register for an account. Once registered and logged in, users can `like` so that they can get recommendations based on what they liked.

### Note
This app was written using `Angular CLI` which was still in beta at the time of writing, therefore it may not be fully compatible with all browsers and versions. However, it works best with newer versions of browsers such as `Google Chrome` and `Firefox`. 

This was strictly implemented for learning purposes as I wanted to learn the `MEAN` stack.

To test it, please use the following credentials, or register a new account:
* `johnsmith@gmail.com`
* `password123`

### Technologies Used
* `Angular 2`
* `Node.js`
* `Express.js`
* `MongoDB`
* `SASS`

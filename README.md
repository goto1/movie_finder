# MOVIEJO

### Description
A Flixter-like web application that allows to browse through and search for movies. It also has a user system that allows to register for an account. Once registered and logged in, users can `like` so that they can get recommendations based on what they liked. Strictly for learning purposes as I wanted to learn to learn `Angular 2`.

### Notes
This app was written using `Angular CLI`, which was still in beta at that time, therefore it may not be fully compatible with certain browsers. It works best with newer versions of browsers such as `Google Chrome` and `Firefox`.
